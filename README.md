# Capstone-Project-Insurance-Claims

# Project Overview
Title: Insurance Claim Analysis

Objective: The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of insurance claim data to understand factors influencing insurance charges and to provide actionable insights for future business decisions. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation analysis, pivot table and chart creation, dummy variable encoding, and multiple linear regression modeling.

# Scope:

- Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's structure and relationships.
- Create visualizations and pivot tables to analyze various aspects of the data.
- Encode categorical variables into dummy variables for regression analysis.
- Conduct multiple linear regression to identify key factors affecting insurance charges.
- Provide insights and recommendations based on the analysis.

# Key Skills
- Data Analysis: Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting data using statistical methods.
- Data Visualization: Ability to create meaningful visualizations such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and pivot charts.
- Statistical Analysis: Knowledge of correlation analysis and regression modeling.
- Data Cleaning: Skills in preparing data for analysis, including encoding categorical variables.
- Tools: Proficiency in using data analysis tools and software.

# Tools Used
- Excel: For creating pivot tables and charts.
- Statistical Software: For performing multiple linear regression analysis.

# Datasets
The dataset includes the following variables:

- Age: Continuous variable representing the age of the customers.
- Gender: Categorical variable with values "Male" and "Female."
- BMI: Continuous variable representing the Body Mass Index of the customers.
- Number of Children/Dependants: Continuous variable representing the number of dependants.
- Smoker: Categorical variable with values "Smoker" and "Non-smoker."
- Region: Categorical variable with values "Northeast," "Northwest," "Southeast," and "Southwest."
- Charges: Continuous variable representing the insurance charges claimed.

# Conclusions
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- The distribution of continuous variables like Age, BMI, and Charges was visualized using histograms and box plots.
- Correlation analysis revealed relationships between Charges and other variables such as Age and BMI.
- Pivot tables and charts provided insights into the distribution of smokers and non-smokers across different regions, as well as the impact of these factors on insurance charges.

- Dummy Variable Encoding:

  - Categorical variables such as Gender, Smoker, and Region were encoded into numerical format to facilitate regression analysis.

- Regression Analysis:

  - Multiple linear regression was performed to identify key predictors of insurance charges.
  - Variables such as BMI, Smoking status, and Age were found to significantly influence the Charges.
  - The model was refined by dropping insignificant variables to improve its predictive accuracy.

- Insights:

  - Smoking status and BMI were strong predictors of insurance charges, with smokers generally incurring higher charges.
  - Regional differences affected insurance charges, with varying impacts across different regions.
  - The number of dependants had a moderate effect on charges, with more dependants generally correlating with higher charges.

# Summary
This project provided a detailed analysis of insurance claim data, highlighting the key factors affecting insurance charges. Through EDA, correlation analysis, and multiple linear regression, significant patterns and relationships were identified. The findings suggest that smoking status, BMI, and age are crucial factors influencing insurance charges, with regional variations also playing a role. The use of dummy variables and regression modeling allowed for a robust analysis, leading to actionable insights that can inform future business decisions and improve targeting strategies.
